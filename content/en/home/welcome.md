The [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/) Farm Animal Cognition and Welfare network consists of the researchers, engineers, technicians and students of the [Departments PHASE](https://www.inrae.fr/departements/phase) and [GA](https://www.inrae.fr/departements/ga) who are interested in animal cognition, welfare and their interrelationship. Members of the network come from about 14 different research laboratories from all over France. They conduct research on a variety of farm animals including sheep, goats, cattle, horses, pigs, trout, poultry and insects. The main expectations of the networkâ€™s members are: 1) to think about the link between cognition and welfare; 2) to discuss the concepts and methods of both cognition and welfare research and; 3) to get to know better colleagues conducting research in these areas.
