abstract: "Environmental enrichment, that is making the environment of animals more complex, was first designed to enhance the welfare and cognitive abilities of captive animals, and was more recently applied to farm animals. Enrichments can be sensory, physical, social, occupational, feeding-based, or a mix of these, with a view to improve animals’ welfare. We posit that enrichments share the common factor of providing information to animals so that enrichment is all about providing the animal with a way to acquire information by interacting with the environment. Animals enjoy acquiring information, and the process of acquiring information acts in a way that enables them to better adapt to future environments. This reframed view of enrichment has several implications including prolonging the duration of exposure to an enrichment does not necessarily increase the impact of that enrichment, neutral and even slightly negative stimuli may still be enriching, complex and variable environments are enriching, and the more intensively an animal can engage with the environment, the more it will benefit from enrichments. These implications should be further explored by comprehensive re-analyses of findings from the enrichment literature and/or by dedicated experiments."
